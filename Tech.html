Whenever we think about deep tech some cool practices and mind boggling set of words strikes our minds. So firstly what is deep tech, “Deep tech” describes companies working with technologies such as advanced material science, artificial intelligence, deep learning, data analytics or biotech to bring completely new<br>scientific discoveries or engineering breakthroughs to businesses. Deep tech has a plethora of practical use in discrete industries around the world which transforms our daily lives and activities.<br></p><p>But now ,here comes an interesting cum shocking thing, imagine what if in near future doctors are partially replaced by a technically mechanized system capable of not only diagnostics for different diseases varying from mild to even severe ones but also treatment and medication according to it. Moreover, consulting even after treatment makes it a full fledged automatized “personal” doctor. Till now you must have got the extraordinarily new revolution taking place in the advancing technological world now:<br></p><p>It can redefine the relationship between cost, accessibility and quality—one that today is badlybroken.<br></p><p>Talking of the healthcare industry "it is one of the most influential industries for an individual and especially for the development of the country as whole ". A proper infrastructure in this domain with efficient and innovative ways could make it a "super power". Incubating deep tech in the healthcare industry is one of the major steps towards this revolution. The question is why it's of<br>such importance and how can it contribute to the same. The answer is simply complicated.<br></p><p>The conception of disruption is nothing new. And the healthcare sector is certainly no stranger to the idea, particularly over recent years. The effect that digital technology has had on patients and clinicians is evident, and it has definitely altered the way care is both accessed and delivered. Using disruptive technologies of deep tech makes the task easier and more efficient<br>,and it conquers over those techniques which are beyond the capacity of human brains. Current technologies eventually block progress and deep tech is the un-blocker. Deep tech describes the radical new solutions that break open these bottlenecks. Medical Science is majorly about research and remodeling the resources and tactics used. Deep tech is the most viable for it, especially Artificial Intelligence as coined is the turning point for today's healthcare dome.<br></p><p>Developments in deep tech startups are shining a light on the future of what’s possible. Nowhere is this more evident than in the healthcare sector, where precision medicine is allowing us to develop highly personalized treatments for individuals, while also gathering more accurate health-related data for analyzing and giving desired results on it.<br></p><p>The wide variety of technologies and their applications cover everything from cancer treatment to enhanced AI diagnosis capabilities to everyday heart-monitoring tools . Extensive use of Deep Tech could potentially provide helpful information for your doctor especially if you’re having symptoms outside of the doctor’s clinic. It indirectly depicts an instant diagnosis. Many cases arise around the world every year in which due to lack of timely diagnosis patients lose their lives. Through the arising technology not only time is saved but also precision is achieved for the proper treatment.<br></p><p>Many existing and upcoming startups use AI capabilities to provide detailed reports on an individual’s genetic makeup. Using this information, they can provide tailored nutritional, training and health advice.<br></p><p>Some deeply oriented techniques towards it could be Imaging , As AI legend "Geoff Hinton" famously declared in recent years , “People should stop training radiologists now. It’s just completely obvious that within 5 years, deep learning is going to do better than radiologists.” Examining a medical scan to determine whether a tumor, a skin lesion, a retinal disease, or some other indication is present is a clear-cut example of object classification, exactly what deep learning excels at.<br></p><p>Patient Intake and Engagement is also a critical part of the healthcare journey. Recent advances in natural language processing have made possible AI-based conversational interfaces that can automate patient screening and care navigation. Patients can share symptoms and questions via text message and receive automated clinical guidance in response. Using AI to automate these<br>interactions can dramatically reduce costs and democratize access to healthcare by making expert health guidance available without the need for human physicians’ expensive time. Remote health, precision medicines, administration in hospitals, In-hospital etc. are more such areas where deep tech marks it's need to make them a level up.<br></p><p>HOW STARTUPS IN INDIA ARE DEALING WITH IT.<br></p><p>One in 17 women in the world are likely to develop abnormalities in the breast that can lead to cancer if not detected early, according to WHO. But regular screening with mammography is expensive and unavailable to many. As a result many patients die across the world even though this is one of the most curable forms of cancer. So here comes a shot of deep tech introduced,<br>Bangalore-based startup Niramai has an alternative: non-invasive thermal imaging that shows lumps in the breast when analyzed by artificial intelligence. The startup has two US patents for its methods of detecting breast tumors, and eight more are pending.<br></p><p>Some companies around the world are working and launching an emergency hemostat – a device designed to stop bleeding in minutes. Axio based in Bangalore in one of the successful startups to patent this technique. The certified and patented Axiostat is now part of the Indian army’s field kit. How many benchmarks are crossed via this, think about it!<br></p><p>Again as talking about India diagnostics is a major area for tech intervention, given that there’s just one doctor available for every 1,700 people. In specialist care, that gets even more compounded. One of the areas here is usage of ECG. The reason why four out of five doctors do not own an ECG machine is because the skill to read an ECG is tough. The waves are complex to read. To resolve this Tricog, established by a cardiologist in Bangalore, tackles the<br>problem of access with cloud-based analytics of ECG data and introduces techniques to make it more accessible for normal doctors and even specialists. It use advances in deep tech (computer science, communication, algorithms) and the cloud to amplify the work for the doctors.<br></p><p>COVID AS A BREAK OUT FOR DEEP TECH CAPABILITIES<br></p><p>COVID-19 has become an unprecedented disruption to all facets of the healthcare industry in a very short amount of time. But Deep Tech in healthcare, as well as other important technologies, are critical to resolving the crisis and for generating future growth.<br></p><p>Artificial intelligence plays a critical role in the fight against COVID-19, including areas like pandemic detection, vaccine development, thermal screening, facial recognition with masks, and analyzing CT scans. BL an application developed by a company from Toronto, Canada, was a major pioneer in early warning systems for identifying pandemics such as COVID-19.<br>BlueDot was the first to publish a paper that predicted COVID-19’s spread worldwide. Bluedot’s system scans over 100,000 media sources worldwide in over 65 different languages daily to ascertain dangerous outbreaks in nearly real time.<br></p><p>For developing new vaccines the goal is to include strongly immunogenic viral components that cause a response from the immune system. With machine assistance, immunologists have identified over one million fragments of proteins on a cell’s surface that are discoverable by T-cells. SYGFQPTNGVGYQPY, a fragment from COVID-19, could be a fragment with these desirable qualities. However, without machine learning assistance, humans alone won’t be able to tell for sure. Thanks to machine learning, COVID-19 vaccine development is continuing quickly.<br></p><p>In thermal screening , AI can quickly parse through many people at once to identify people with high temperatures. This can help to identify symptomatic individuals. Deep learning systems in facial recognition technology have improved enough that they can identify individuals with masks with accuracy of up to 95%. Human error is a problem in CT scan analysis. Artificial intelligence can detect pneumonia caused by COVID-19 in chest CT scans via multinational training data for machine learning. By combining IoT with telemedicine and telehealth technologies a new term is coined "Internet of Medical Things" which in turn helps to measure common and advanced medical terms of the user such as skin temperature, glucose level, blood pressure readings etc.<br></p><p>And there are ample more of new deep tech innovations contributing to the pandemic very crucially and completely transforming the healthcare industry. It's just a matter of spark and desire to change the world and make it a healthy place to live. Healthcare is an intimate part of our personal and family lives in a way that no other sector of the economy is. It is therefore particularly troubling how dysfunctional the healthcare system is<br>today. No technology can be a silver bullet for a system as complex as modern healthcare. Deep Tech in it offers the potential to rewrite the rules. When deployed thoughtfully, It can redefine the relationship between cost, accessibility and quality "one that today is badly broken".<br></p><p>Thinking of starting your healthcare company? Now is the time and opportunity to do it. If you have the potential (obviously :p )<br></p><p></p></div></div></div></article><footer><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 mx-auto"><p class="text-muted copyright">Copyright&nbsp;© Entrepreneurial Ethics 2021</p><p class="text-muted copyright">All rights reserved.</p></div></div></div></footer><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/4.6.0/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script><script src="smart-forms.min.js"></script><script src="script.min.js"></script></body></html>
